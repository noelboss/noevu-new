These instructions will help you to create the perfect portrait.


### The most important points in brief:


*  Leave some space around your head For a well-balanced portrait
  

*  Use natural light Stand next to a window and look into the light
  

*  Use autofocus To ensure your photos are sharp and clear
  

#### What you need:


*  **Modern smartphone:** Any newer smartphone, regardless of brand, can take the quality photos we need.
  

*  Helping person: Find someone who can help you take the photo, or follow our guide below to do it yourself!
  

*  A few minutes: Allow 15 minutes-the process is simple and straightforward.


*  #### Location: Where do I take the portrait? 

  
  **1** - Find a natural light source **inside the building**
  
  Use natural light for your portrait and avoid artificial light from ceiling or floor lamps. Smartphone cameras work best indoors in bright daylight.
  
  **2** - Go close to the window (and look out)
  
  You will get the best portrait if you stand directly in front of a large window. Face the window to avoid unsightly shadows. The person taking the photo has the light behind them.
  
  **Pro tip** - Avoid backlighting
  
  If you position yourself so that you are looking out of the window, this means that the person taking the photo has the light source behind them.
  

*  #### Taking a photo: What do I have to consider? 

  
  **1** - Choose a generous image section (from the hip upwards)
  
  You should be in the center of the screen. The bottom edge of the screen should be level with your navel. There should be enough space to the left, right and above your head.
  
  **2** - Keep a distance of approx. 1.5 meters and look directly into the lens (camera at eye level)
  
  Ask the person taking the photo to stand about 1 - 1.5 meters away from you and hold the camera at eye level. Looking directly into the camera creates sympathy.
  
  **Pro tip** - always shoot in landscape format
  
  Make sure that your smartphone is held in landscape format and at eye level. You should be in the center of the screen. There should be some space around you.
  
  **Pro tip** - don't use portrait mode (we do it better for you)
  
  Modern smartphones offer the option of blurring the background - this is called "portrait mode". Our first-class photo editors crop you much better than this automatic function on your smartphone. Also avoid the selfie and wide-angle camera.
  

*  #### Pose: How do I stand correctly? 

  
  **1** - Turn 30° to the left or right
  
  Stand facing the window and then turn slightly 30° to the left or right - whichever feels more comfortable for you.
  
  **2** - Pay attention to your hands: you'll automatically adopt a good posture!
  
  Hold your thumb firmly with one hand and bend your arms slightly. This automatically ensures an upright posture. Alternatively, you can put your hands in your trouser pockets - your thumbs should remain visible. Relax your shoulders and pull them back slightly.
  
  **3** - Turn your head towards the camera - and smile
  
  Simply turn your head towards the camera and look directly into the lens. Your upper body should remain slightly angled. Give the other person a smile and think of something nice - perhaps your last vacation or the anticipation of your next trip to the mountains.
  
  **Pro tip** - Take enough photos
  
  Take lots of shots and try out different poses and facial expressions. This way you can choose the best picture later.
