### Article content

!\[The new website for the MIGO compensation fund was developed by Noevu in collaboration with OPTEN.\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/c40691cb-d1aa-4c9b-87a3-0a148134b0eb/%C3%9 Cbersichtliche+neue+Website+Ausgleichskasse+der+Migros.png)


#### When the managing directors of the Migros compensation fund contacted us, the starting point was clear: the existing Typo3 website was getting on in years and the design looked outdated. The desire was for a visual modernization—the site should be "pretty" again. But in the course of the project, it quickly became clear that we would not settle for "pretty." We want excellence.


### The most important facts in brief


*  **Design as an anchor of trust:**Why "beautiful" and "serious" belong together and how modern UI strengthens brand perception.
  

*  **User focus:**Five clear life situations (e.g., "Partnership & Family") replace internal departmental logic.
  

*  **Plain language instead of jargon:**We translate "officialese" into understandable language: What? Who? Contact?
  

*  **Data protection plus:**Swiss hosting, Cookiebot, and a two-click solution for videos guarantee compliance that goes far beyond the standard.
  

*  **Technology:** Why**Umbraco**offers the stability and security that US solutions such as Webflow often cannot provide.


### Inviting home page

The user-friendly homepage prominently displays the search function, followed by frequently asked questions. Next, various life situations provide quick access to the desired information.


### Structured concerns overview

The concerns of insured persons can be filtered according to life situations and various topic groups. Each concern is clearly listed and easy to find using a simple search function.


### Informative detail page

Each issue is explained clearly, including the persons affected and the relevant contact persons. Explanatory videos, FAQs, and all relevant forms and information sheets complement the service.

The result is impressive: the new [**akmigros.ch**](http://akmigros.ch/) is probably the most attractive compensation fund website in Switzerland at present. But it is much more than just an aesthetic shell. Since the AHV 21 reform, your website has become the most important service channel. That is why we have combined aesthetics with radical functionality. Because good design is not an end in itself – it enables the service that insured persons expect today.


### Customer


*  Migros Compensation Fund (AK Migros)
  

*  1st pillar for Migros and affiliated companies and their insured persons


### **Project**


*  Strategic UX consulting & workshops
  

*  Content strategy & plain language editing
  

*  Web design and development on Umbraco in collaboration with [OPTEN AG](http://opten.ch/)
  

*  Technical implementation & ISDS compliance


### Special features


*  **Hosting:**100% Switzerland (ISDS compliant)
  

*  **UX:**Navigation based on use cases and 5 life situations
  

*  **Languages:** Trilingual in German, French, and Italian
  

*  **Design:**Exclusive, AI-generated imagery in the Migros look


## Why are technical jargon and departmental thinking no longer sufficient today?

Be honest: would a layperson visiting your current website immediately understand the difference between an "IK statement" and an "insurance certificate"? First pillar websites have often evolved over time. They reflect the internal organizational structure and use the language of legal texts.

This is a significant hurdle for users. They don't think in terms of departments such as "contributions," but rather have a specific problem. When they are then confronted with an outdated look and incomprehensible bureaucratic language, their confidence wanes and they pick up the phone. This ties up unnecessary resources in your support department. This is exactly where the**Migros Compensation Office**project came in: we wanted to prove that a government website can be modern, inviting, and understandable.


## How does structuring according to five life situations work?

The biggest lever in**UX design for social insurance**is information architecture. In the case of AK Migros, we took off our internal glasses in a joint UX workshop. Instead of mapping the organizational structure of the insurance company, we geared the navigation completely toward the reality of life for the insured.

!\[In a UX workshop for the compensation fund, we worked together to put ourselves in the shoes of the target groups and understand their needs.\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/74ba6a4b-ccfa-49cf-82ee-826967ebd932/In+einem+UX+Workshop+haben+wir+mit+der+Ausgleichskasse+die+Kundensicht+eingenommen)

The content is now divided into**five key life situations** that users can intuitively understand:


*  **Partnership & Family**
  

*  **Working life & contributions**
  

*  **Retirement & Pension**
  

*  **disability**
  

*  **Military & Civil Defense**
  
This approach meets users where they are emotionally. Anyone expecting a child clicks on "Family" without needing to know what specific form is behind it. The design supports this clarity with plenty of white space and a tidy structure that radiates calm.


### What are the benefits of "My Concerns" and User Intent Clusters?

In addition to life situations, the**"My concerns"**section offers quick access for users who know exactly what they want. Whether it's "Change address," "Order account statement," or "Report death," these top tasks are prominently displayed. Not only does this look good, it also prevents users from having to search through submenus.


## How do we translate "officialese" into understandable language?

A beautiful cover is of little use if the text is incomprehensible. That's why we at AK Migros have consistently focused on**plain language**. We don't just throw a PDF at the user, but frame each topic with three clear questions:


*  **What exactly does this concern mean?**(Simple definition without a jungle of paragraphs)
  

*  **Who is affected?**(Clear target group approach)
  

*  **Who should I contact?**(Direct contact or responsibility)
  

### How do videos and design build trust?

To further break down barriers, the new site relies on multimedia. Where text alone seems dry, we incorporate**explanatory videos from the AHV/IV information center**. These explain complex relationships visually and simply.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/e1166ecf-f164-45de-9ed7-30b3d77ccc7e/Dia-Meine+AHV-Beitragskarrie%E2%80%A6-Screenshot-2026-01-22-14-52-56.png)

At the same time, the visual design is key: thanks to modern typography and high-quality imagery, the site does not look like a "government agency" but rather like a modern service provider. **An exciting detail:**the images, which fit perfectly into the familiar Migros look and feel, were generated using artificial intelligence (AI). This enabled us to cost-effectively create an exclusive and consistent visual world that combines innovation and tradition.

We take data protection very seriously: external content from YouTube or Vimeo is only loaded once the user has actively consented (two-click solution). This keeps the site clean and compliant with data protection regulations.


## Why choose Umbraco as a CMS instead of a SaaS solution such as Webflow or Squarespace?

A**website relaunch for a compensation fund**must not only be stable, but also meet the highest data protection requirements. The data must remain in Switzerland.

This was a decisive factor for popular construction kits such as Webflow and Squarespace, which host their data in the USA. AK Migros therefore made a conscious decision to choose**Umbraco**:


*  **Hosting in Switzerland:**We guarantee that all data remains in the country. This was already the standard for ISDS compliance on the old site, but was retained without compromise during the relaunch.
  

*  **Stability & operation:**Umbraco offers extremely high stability and is still very easy to use for AK Migros editors.
  

*  **Enhanced data protection:** We have gone a step further than just being "ISDS-compliant." With the use of**Cookiebot**and completely revised data protection guidelines, we ensure that the website complies with the latest legal requirements.

Conclusion: Combining design and function

The relaunch of AK Migros shows that you don't have to choose: a website can be functional, secure, AND beautiful. By having the courage to use design as a strategic tool, translate technical jargon, and rely on Swiss hosting, a platform has been created that sets standards in the first pillar.

For you as a compensation fund, this means that a relaunch is an opportunity to shake off your dusty image. Show your policyholders that you are a modern partner.

## FAQ: Frequently asked questions about websites for social insurance and compensation funds


*  #### Why does it make sense for compensation funds to sort by life events? 

  
  Insured persons usually do not search for technical terms such as "EO," but rather for solutions to their situation (e.g., "birth" or "military"). A structure based on the five life situations makes navigation intuitive and reduces obstacles.
  

*  #### Where do the images on the website come from? 

  
  We generated the images using artificial intelligence (AI). This allowed us to cost-effectively create an exclusive image world in the "Migros look" that looks modern and fits the brand perfectly, without having to organize costly photo shoots.
  

*  #### Is the new website accessible? 

  
  Absolutely. Accessibility is essential for a compensation fund. The website was developed in accordance with current accessibility standards to ensure that people with disabilities can also access it without any problems.
  

*  #### Why do you use Umbraco and not Webflow? 

  
  For compensation funds, data must often be stored in Switzerland. Webflow primarily hosts in the US. Umbraco allows us to host in Switzerland, offers greater stability, and provides full control over data protection issues such as cookie consent.
  

*  #### What makes the new site better in terms of data protection? 

  
  In addition to proven Swiss hosting, we use Cookiebot for consent management, revised privacy policies, and block external content (e.g., videos) until the user grants permission.
  

*  #### Does Noevu offer support after go-live? 

  
  Yes, we offer comprehensive support after go-live. Our service packages include hosting support, security, support hours, and continuous optimization to ensure that your website remains up to date and successful in the long term. We also train you so that you can maintain content independently.
