#### mobileo GmbH, a leading provider of Segway tours in Switzerland, was facing a major challenge: its website was technologically and conceptually outdated. It was no longer able to effectively present the unique experience and comprehensive range of tours and motivate visitors to book. Together, we fundamentally changed this situation. As experienced Swiss premium Squarespace web designers, we not only implemented a redesign, but also created a completely new digital experience platform based on a sound brand strategy and state-of-the-art technology.  


## The customer & the challenge: An outdated platform

The old mobileo website could no longer keep up with the dynamism and fun factor of their Segway tours. A confusing structure and an outdated design led to a poor user experience and prevented potential customers from recognizing the true value of the offer.


### Customer


*  **Client:** [mobileo GmbH](https://mobileo.cj/), the expert for unforgettable Segway experiences throughout Switzerland for 15 years.
  

*  **Industry:** Tourism & Leisure.
  

*  **Offer:** Professionally guided Segway tours at over 20 destinations, company events and private groups.


### Project


*  Strategic realignment of communication
  

*  Development of an individual, modern web design
  

*  Creation of teaser videos for various destinations and AI imagery for areas where image material was missing.
  

*  Complete technical website development on Squarespace
  

*  Implementation of a multilingual solution (DE, FR, EN)
  

*  Integration of an advanced filter function for tours
  

*  Development of dynamic, easy-to-add Swiss tour map


### Special features


*  Replacement of an outdated, complex in-house development (Weblication/XSLT).
  

*  Need for ease of use for the mobileo team.
  

*  The large number of tours required an intelligent and user-friendly filter solution, inspired by platforms such as Airbnb.
  

*  The new website had to convey a clear message based on neuromarketing triggers.


## The solution: a modern experience platform that makes driving fun a digital experience

Our solution was a professionally developed new website based on Squarespace. As Swiss Squarespace experts, we knew that this platform offered the ideal combination of design freedom, ease of use and technical reliability. Instead of adapting a standard theme, we developed a completely customized design that perfectly conveys mobileo's new, dynamic brand message and focuses entirely on the user experience and the ease of booking tours.


## Our **approach**: From strategic analysis to digital experience

An outstanding result requires a well thought-out approach. Our process was divided into clearly defined phases to ensure maximum transparency and efficiency.


### 1\. analysis, strategy & concept: the foundation for success

It all began with a deep dive into the world of mobileo. Together with our strategy partner Martin Künzi from [mosaik.partners](https://www.mosaik.partners/?utm_source=noevu.ch), we sharpened the brand identity in a workshop. Based on neuromarketing triggers, we defined a new tonality - "smooth mobility, cool vehicle, fun, informative, dynamic" - which formed the foundation for all further steps.

### 2\. individual web design & interactive prototypes: Making the experience tangible

Beautiful web design is more than just good looks. It's the feeling a website conveys and how it strategically guides visitors. We created several interactive design prototypes that gave mobileo a realistic preview of the future user experience. This allowed us to ensure that the design not only looked modern, but also conveyed the strategically defined message visually and guided users intuitively through the site.


### Feel & Flow

Emotions first - discover by immersionMany people are not familiar with the fascinating Segway experience. This variant conveys the emotions with moving images, videos and scroll-based sections on a dark background that create curiosity and atmosphere. Only then do the tour finder and booking follow.


### Explore & Book

Focus on conversion - directly to the experience

It relies on the tried and tested and guides visitors quickly to the experience. Inspired by platforms such as Airbnb, it uses a lean, conversion-optimized layout.

A variety of tours speak for themselves, supported by emotional videos that arouse curiosity. Featured tours, a tour finder and a calendar provide an immediate overview and orientation.

The emotional part follows and underlines the experience.


### 3\. efficient website development with Squarespace: focus on the essentials

By choosing Squarespace, we were able to fully focus our energy on the strategic aspects, design and usability instead of letting it fizzle out in complex technical development. As experienced Swiss Squarespace developers, we made optimal use of the platform and adapted it to the specific needs of mobileo with clever extensions, such as a customized tour filter. A specially developed importer also ensured that all existing tours were quickly and easily transferred to the new system.


### 4\. launch & continuous optimization: a partner for the future

The launch was just the beginning. We ensured a smooth launch and trained the mobileo team so that they could easily maintain content such as city overviews or new tours themselves. With our [service packages, we ensure](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-hilfe.html) that new websites remain technically up to date and are continuously optimized in the future.


## The result: a future-proof platform that inspires and converts

The result is a fast, modern and SEO-optimized website that finally brings the unique experience of mobileo Segway tours to life digitally. The intuitive navigation and powerful filter guide visitors directly to their desired tour, while the clear, emotional imagery and compelling texts whet the appetite for the next adventure. The platform is not only a benefit for visitors, but also for the mobileo team, who can now easily manage their content themselves.
