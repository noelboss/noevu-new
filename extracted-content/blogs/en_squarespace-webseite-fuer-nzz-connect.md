## The challenge - it has to be quick!


#### As Swiss Squarespace experts, we were able to implement the website for NZZ Connect, one of the leading organizers of business events, for their renowned cybersecurity seminar. The main challenge was to replace an aging and high-maintenance WordPress system with a modern, flexible and, above all, highly secure platform - under considerable time pressure. We chose Squarespace to ensure a fast, yet robust and strategically sound website development that meets the high standards of NZZ Connect and the sensitive issue of cybersecurity.

## The solution: Strategic web design & development

The task was clear: to create a digital platform that is not only quickly ready for use, but also exudes security and professionalism.

Given the tight schedule and high security requirements, the decision to use Squarespace was a strategic one. As your Swiss Squarespace partner, we know that this all-in-one platform offers the perfect basis for such projects. Instead of spending time maintaining plugins and worrying about security vulnerabilities, we were able to concentrate fully on the strategic implementation.

We have developed a customized solution that faithfully reflects the sophisticated design of NZZ Connect. Thanks to Squarespace's SaaS architecture and the Cloudflare integration we implemented, the website benefits from robust, multi-layered protection against cyberattacks. The intuitive user interface also allows the NZZ Connect team to manage content such as program overviews or speaker profiles completely autonomously and efficiently. This leaves more time for the essentials: the excellence of the event content.

As your **Squarespace expert Switzerland**, we have created a solution that specifically masters the original challenges and creates sustainable added value.

*  **Efficient and autonomous:** We have proven that first-class **web design** does not require months of development time. The website went live within the ambitious time frame of just two weeks. The NZZ Connect team can now maintain content completely autonomously, which minimizes administrative effort and frees up resources for the core business.
  

*  **Professional and user-friendly:** The result is a visually appealing and clearly structured website that perfectly represents the NZZ Connect brand. For seminar participants, the site offers a seamless experience - from the initial information to the exclusive download of documents in the password-protected area.
  
With this successful **website development**, we have created a digital basis for NZZ Connect that is not only secure and agile, but also meets the high quality demands of its audience.
