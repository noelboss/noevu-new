This is the most important "button" in the Squarespace CMS. But before you press it, it is important to carry out the following steps carefully.


## Why is good preparation important for the go-live?


#### The launch of a new website is a decisive milestone. For your company, this moment is the ignition for sustainable digital growth, greater visibility in search engines and ultimately more qualified customer inquiries. But success doesn't happen by chance - it is the result of careful and strategic preparation. Setting the right course from the outset avoids costly mistakes and lays the foundation for an online presence that really works for the company.

Putting a website online today is technically simple. However, launching a website that is strategically on course for success from the outset requires foresight and know-how.

It's about sending clear signals to search engines like Google that your content is relevant to the Swiss market. At the same time, you need to offer your visitors a seamless and compelling experience that converts them from prospects to loyal customers. Follow these steps to not only publish your website, but to strategically launch it.

Before you press the big ominous "Publish website" button, the course must be set carefully and correctly. These fundamental steps form the technical and strategic backbone of your successful new online presence and lay the foundation for sustainable growth. Take enough time for this - it's worth it.


## 1\. what do you have to consider for good SEO with Squarespace?

Here we make sure that Google & Co. immediately understand who you are and what you offer. This metadata is your digital figurehead.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/817d261f-e228-4f41-9c2b-310aeed27bca/Safari-Personal+%E2%80%94+Davatz+Legal+AG+%E2%80%94+Erb-+&+Familienrecht+und+Gesellschafts-+&+Vertragsrecht-Screenshot-2025-07-17-11-34-51.png)

A favicon is often forgotten - this leads to the standard Squarespace logo appearing on your website. This looks very unprofessional.


*  **Global page titles and SEO descriptions:** For each individual page, assign a concise, keyword-optimized title (max. 60 characters) and a compelling meta description (approx. 155 characters). The title should contain the main keyword of the page and your brand name. The description is your free advertising space: it must encourage people to click and clearly communicate the benefits. These texts are often the first thing potential customers see of you.
  

*  **Logical URL structure:** Pay attention to short, "speaking" URLs (e.g. `eurefirma.ch/premium-webdesign`). Avoid cryptic URLs with numbers or unnecessary filler words. A clean URL structure not only helps users to find their way around, but also signals the hierarchy and content of your pages to search engines.
  

*  **Unique browser icon (favicon):** Add a sharp, recognizable favicon. It strengthens your brand presence in the browser tab, in bookmarks and even in mobile search results. It's a small detail that radiates professionalism and attention to detail.


* * *


## 2\. how do I make sure that my website is ready for go-live?

A **premium web design** is much more than just a beautiful facade. It is the perfect symbiosis of aesthetics, intuitive functionality (usability) and strategically prepared content that attracts and convinces your target group.


*  **Mobile-first optimization:**  Test your website intensively on various smartphones and tablets. The majority of Swiss people surf on mobile devices. Make sure that texts are legible, buttons are easy to click and all functions can also be used properly on small screens. Squarespace offers a good basis here, but individual adjustments can be crucial.
  

*  **Intuitive navigation and internal linking:**  Ensure a clear and logical menu structure. Your visitors should be able to access the most important information with a maximum of three clicks. In addition, set strategic internal links from strong pages to weaker ones in order to distribute the SEO power (link juice) across your entire site and to clarify thematic connections for Google.
  

*  **Image optimization and alt texts:**   Compress all image files (ideally under 500 KB, better still under 300 KB) to keep the loading time to a minimum. Name the files logically before uploading (e.g. `premium-webdesign-switzerland-noevu.jpg`). Formulate a careful and descriptive alt text with relevant keywords for each image - this is crucial for accessibility (screen readers) and image SEO.
  

*  **Social media integration:**  Link your social media channels and store an appealing social sharing image for each important page (in the Squarespace SEO tab). This will ensure that your brand looks professional and inviting when your content is shared on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook & Co.

For new Squarespace 7.1 websites, the mobile layout of the page can - no, must - be checked. It is simple, but is quickly forgotten. A blue symbol in the smartphone view shows that new elements have not yet been checked.


## 3\. what legal things do I need to consider before launching my Squarespace websites?

Legal certainty and local findability go hand in hand. For Swiss SMEs in particular, it is crucial to build trust with customers and search engines from the outset and to fully comply with local regulations.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/80967e9a-2d74-482f-837c-c7ae694a707d/Safari-Personal+%E2%80%94+Privacy+Policy+2+%E2%80%94+Noevu+GmbH-Screenshot-2025-07-17-11-41-37.png)

It is advisable to have the data protection guidelines checked by a lawyer. Especially for larger websites.


*  **Legal pages (Swiss-compliant):**  Create a complete legal notice and a privacy policy adapted to the new Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG). Make sure that your cookie banner offers users a real choice. For online stores, there are also general terms and conditions and revocation instructions.
  
  *check\_box*  ***Expert tip:***   The legal requirements are complex and changing.

*  **Optimized Google Business Profile:**  This is your most important and powerful tool for local search. Set up your profile completely and in detail: with exact address, opening hours, all relevant services, professional photos and actively collect customer reviews. Also use the post function to share news. This will get you top placement on Google Maps and in local searches such as "web designer in Zurich".
  

*  **Location integration on the website:**  Integrate a dedicated contact page with address, phone number (in international format) and an embedded map. This information should be repeated consistently in the footer on every page. This is a clear and strong signal to Google that you are an established, local business.


## 4\. how do I make sure that the changeover from the old to the new site works?

Make sure that the technology in the background is running smoothly and efficiently. Technical errors can ruin your SEO efforts before they've even had a chance.


*  **SSL encryption:** Make sure that your domain has active and correctly set up SSL encryption (`https://`). This is an official ranking factor, protects your visitors' data and is an absolute must for trust.
  

*  **Individual 404 error page:** Design a friendly and helpful 404 page. Visitors who click on a dead link should not end up in the void. Provide them with a search function, links to the most important pages and perhaps a humorous message to avoid frustration and keep them on your site.
  

*  **Essential 301 redirects:** If you are replacing an existing website, this step is absolutely critical. You must set up a permanent redirect (301 redirect) to the corresponding new page for every single old URL. This is the only way to transfer the existing SEO strength to the new page and avoid ranking losses.
  
  *check\_box*  ***Expert tip:***   Managing hundreds of redirects can be error-prone.

*  **Check indexability:** Perform a final crawl with an SEO tool or manually check the page settings to ensure that all relevant pages are visible to Google and that no important page is accidentally set to "noindex". Don't forget to remove the password lock from the development page.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/79919a73-3f69-4f18-a6cb-6b392767b8a2/Safari-Personal+%E2%80%94+Privacy+Policy+2+%E2%80%94+Noevu+GmbH-Screenshot-2025-07-17-11-47-01.png)

Redirect old URLs! When switching from an old website to a new one, this step is often forgotten by non-experts. However, it is crucial for a successful relaunch without losing valuable Google rankings.


## 5\. what do I have to consider after launching my new Squarespace site?

The work is not done with the launch - it is only just beginning. A successful website is a living ecosystem that needs to be maintained and developed.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/7ddb231c-d173-4346-8e1d-e575bf19e638/Safari-Personal+%E2%80%94+Privacy+Policy+2+%E2%80%94+Noevu+GmbH-Screenshot-2025-07-17-11-54-11.png)

The SEO settings give you a simple insight and help you to permanently optimize your new website. Under "Analytics" you can connect the new website to Google Search Console with one click.


*  **Set up Google Search Console:**  To connect your Squarespace website directly to the Google Search Console, go to the Squarespace backend to the tab `Analysis` > `Search terms`. There you will find the option to link your website. This step allows Google to crawl your website efficiently and provides you with priceless data. The connection is essential because it provides you with valuable insights into the search behavior of your visitors (e.g. which keywords bring clicks) and helps you to implement targeted SEO measures.
  

*  **Register your website with Google & Bing:**  Submit your new website to the search engines by entering the sitemap (the URL is usually `euredomain.ch/sitemap.xml`) is actively submitted. You can do this via the respective webmaster tools (Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools). By submitting the sitemap, you give the search engines a map of your site and significantly speed up the indexing process.
  

*  **Carry out regular monitoring:**  Keep a constant eye on your rankings for the most important keywords, organic visitor numbers and user behavior (e.g. dwell time, bounce rate). Use analysis tools such as Google Analytics and the reports in the Google Search Console to gain detailed insights. This allows you to identify potential for optimization and react quickly to changes in the market or at Google.
  

*  **Continuous optimization:**  SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Regularly create new, high-quality, **SEO-optimized content** that answers your target group's questions. Update existing pages and blog articles to keep them fresh and relevant. Make strategic adjustments based on the analysis data to constantly improve the user experience.

## What are the most important questions about Squarespace Go-Live?


*  #### How long does it take for my new website to be found on Google? 

  
  It usually takes a few days to two weeks for Google to fully index a new page. You can speed up this process by actively submitting your sitemap to Google Search Console as described above.
  

*  #### Is a Google Business Profile really that important for my SME? 

  
  Yes, absolutely! For any Swiss SME with a local or regional focus, an optimized Google Business Profile is the key to visibility in your immediate area. It is your free, interactive shop window in Google Search and on Google Maps.
  

*  #### What do I need to look out for in the legal texts for Switzerland? 

  
  The most important thing is conformity with the new Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG). Imprint and a transparent privacy policy are mandatory. A correct cookie notice that gives the user a real, informed choice (opt-in for non-essential cookies) is becoming increasingly important and is a sign of seriousness.
  

*  #### How do I find the right keywords as an SME? 

  
  Start with a well-founded keyword analysis: Put yourself in your customers' shoes. What terms, problems and questions do they enter into Google? Use tools such as the Google Keyword Planner, but also look at the "similar questions" box in the Google results. Analyze the competition to find the search terms that really bring you qualified inquiries.
  

*  #### What is the biggest lever after go-live? 

  
  Stay active and be patient! The greatest lever for sustainable success is the continuous creation of relevant, high-quality content. A blog with expert articles, detailed project presentations (case studies) or a comprehensive advice section show Google that your site is an authority in your field. This always pays off in the long term.

## What are the most important questions about Squarespace Go-Live?


*  #### How long does it take for my new website to be found on Google? 

  
  It usually takes a few days to two weeks for Google to fully index a new page. You can speed up this process by actively submitting your sitemap to Google Search Console as described above.
  

*  #### Is a Google Business Profile really that important for my SME? 

  
  Yes, absolutely! For any Swiss SME with a local or regional focus, an optimized Google Business Profile is the key to visibility in your immediate area. It is your free, interactive shop window in Google Search and on Google Maps.
  

*  #### What do I need to look out for in the legal texts for Switzerland? 

  
  The most important thing is conformity with the new Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG). Imprint and a transparent privacy policy are mandatory. A correct cookie notice that gives the user a real, informed choice (opt-in for non-essential cookies) is becoming increasingly important and is a sign of seriousness.
  

*  #### How do I find the right keywords as an SME? 

  
  Start with a well-founded keyword analysis: Put yourself in your customers' shoes. What terms, problems and questions do they enter into Google? Use tools such as the Google Keyword Planner, but also look at the "similar questions" box in the Google results. Analyze the competition to find the search terms that really bring you qualified inquiries.
  

*  #### What is the biggest lever after go-live? 

  
  Stay active and be patient! The greatest lever for sustainable success is the continuous creation of relevant, high-quality content. A blog with expert articles, detailed project presentations (case studies) or a comprehensive advice section show Google that your site is an authority in your field. This always pays off in the long term.

They usually lack the time, the know-how or only have the choice between expensive agency solutions or mediocre standard templates. My goal is to support Swiss SMEs with modern, customer-centric digital solutions of the highest quality thanks to smart tools and efficient processes - at a price that remains affordable for SMEs.  

With over 25 years of experience in web design, marketing and digital strategy, I help create online presences that not only look good, but also deliver results. As a [Swiss Squarespace expert](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespcae-webdesign.html), I combine efficiency, usability and aesthetic design to create websites that work for the long term and enable growth.
