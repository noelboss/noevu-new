#### As Swiss Squarespace experts, we were able to create more than just a website for C & R Rrevival GmbH. We accompanied them in the birth of their digital identity. Rrevival had a strong vision, decades of experience and a clear mission: to breathe new life into organizations. What was missing was a digital home that would reflect this expertise and build trust with decision makers. Our task was to develop a holistic brand presence - from strategic positioning and branding to website development and an innovative, AI-powered visual language.

## The challenge - no presence yet

The biggest challenge was to translate a brand without any online presence into a captivating digital experience. The aim was to make Rrevival's unique consulting approach visible and to create a platform that not only informs, but also encourages interaction and generates leads.


## The solution: Strategic web design & development

A company like Rrevival deserves a brand that not only looks modern, but also authentically conveys its mission. Our approach as **Squarespace Experts Switzerland** therefore went far beyond classic **web design**.


### 1\. fundamental branding as a basis

The project began with an intensive UX workshop to define the target groups, market environment and communication goals. Building on this, three interactive prototypes were created that tested different visual and functional directions. At the same time, a timeless branding was developed together with the renowned Swiss designer Vincent Ghilione from Polychrome.ch. The logo, a fusion of two "R "s to form a dynamic growth arrow, symbolizes innovation and progress. The striking color scheme of Mystic Lavender & Absolute Black radiates seriousness and innovation as well as strategic foresight and creates the basis for a credible digital presence.

### 2\. website development with strategy and Squarespace

Special attention was paid to the integration of modern technologies. The new website was implemented on Squarespace - supplemented by custom code for perfect design precision.


*  **Sitemap & wireframes:** Based on the results of the UX workshop, we developed an intuitive site structure tailored to the needs of the target personas (CEO, HR manager).
  

*  **Interactive design prototypes:** Instead of static designs, we presented three fully interactive prototypes. This allowed Rrevival to really experience the designs and select the best possible user experience.
  

*  **Multilingual & responsive implementation:** The website was developed seamlessly in German, French and English and optimized for all end devices in order to optimally serve the more than 70% mobile traffic.
  

### Two live design prototypes


### First Class

First Class combines timeless elegance with courage and warmth. Bright colors, a concise serif font for headlines and clear sans serifs for texts create trust and clarity. The visual language focuses on humanity, growth and positive change and emphasizes the dynamic, future-oriented character of the brand.


### Pathfinder

Pathfinder combines bold contrasts with clear, straightforward headlines. Dark and light sections create dynamism, while a thin, condensed sans-serif font for headlines is complemented by a matching non-condensed variant. The visual language combines performance with security and radiates strength and reliability.


* * *


### 3\. forward-looking visual language - AI-supported visual communication

To set ourselves apart from generic stock photos, we created a unique visual world for Rrevival. The result was a tailor-made AI solution: an individual prompt system for CI-compliant visuals and training that enables the Rrevival team to create high-quality images independently - sustainably, efficiently and true to the brand.


*  **Custom AI image world:** We developed a ChatGPT-based prompt system that generates brand-compliant instructions for image creation.
  

*  **Unique visuals:** All images were created using a specific color and light composition that perfectly matches the corporate identity.
  

*  **Empowerment of the client:** We trained the Rrevival team to remain self-sufficient in the long term and independently create high-quality AI images for future content.


## The result

The result is a modern, trilingual website that makes Rrevival digitally visible for the first time - structured, convincing and SEO-optimized. The site not only conveys content, but also attitude. It conveys at first glance what the company stands for - and where it is heading. Targeted call-to-actions, thought leadership content and a flexible CMS turn the website into an active platform for new customer acquisition and positioning.

The combination of AI imagery, clear *brand identity* and technical sophistication makes the new website a strategic asset. It strengthens the trust of potential customers, sets Rrevival apart from the market and creates the basis for future growth - digitally, visibly and independently.

How good it *looks*


## What we have learned from the project

The digital birth of Rrevival impressively demonstrates that a website is not an isolated product, but a strategic tool for brand positioning, customer acquisition and thought leadership.


*  **Branding is the foundation:** an unmistakable identity is the basis for all successful digital communication.
  

*  **UX strategy is decisive:** A well thought-out user experience, tested through interactive prototypes, increases engagement and conversions.
  

*  **AI technology strengthens brands:** Smart tools for content and visuals not only ensure consistency, but also enable our customers to develop their brand independently.
