### Why was the old website for the dental laboratory no longer up to date?

Vogel Dentaltechnik GmbH is a leading **dental laboratory** in Switzerland, known for its high quality standards and innovative solutions. However, its previous website could no longer keep pace with this development - it was technologically outdated and did not reflect the true potential of the company.

The task was clear: a complete relaunch. As the commissioned [**Swiss Squarespace experts**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-agentur.html) we were to create a new [**homepage for the dental laboratory**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-agentur/webseiten-entwicklung.html) that is not only modern and user-friendly, but also appeals to and convinces dentists and patients.

## How does strategic web design create added value for dental technicians?

A mere redesign was not enough. Our approach was a structured process based on a deep understanding of the needs of the dental industry.


### Kick-off and user experience workshop

The process began with an interactive **user experience workshop** . Here we analyzed the target groups - dentists and patients - to develop a [**new** **website for the dental laboratory**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/webdesign-agentur/kmu-webseite-erstellen-lassen.html) that offers real added value. These findings formed the foundation for the entire content and design strategy.

> ### "Although we needed a short familiarization phase at the beginning as people from outside the industry, Noevu gave us excellent guidance. The recognizable added value of the workshop was obvious to us."

> 
> \- Benedikt Vogel, Managing Director

### Live **design prototypes** and visual creation

Based on the results of the UX workshop, we presented the Vogel Dental team with three different design directions in the form of prototypes. This step is crucial in order to convey a feeling for the future appearance at an early stage and to make strategic decisions. Together, we selected the direction that best conveyed the company's core values: modern, user-centered and highly professional. This design was further refined and perfected in the following steps.


### Design 1 - Classic. Fresh.

emotional - individual - modern This design represents a combination of modern clarity and individual craftsmanship. The colors used are soft and inviting, creating a warm and trusting atmosphere. The typography is modern and easy to read without being cold. The unique selling point of this design is the harmonious combination of contemporary aesthetics with a sense of quality craftsmanship and emotion.


### Design 2 - Dynamic. Cheeky.

With this design, the focus is on inviting dynamism and professionalism. The color palette is fresh and energetic, underlining the innovative strength and future orientation. The fonts here are deliberately straightforward and based on the logo to convey competence and expertise. The design is characterized by a dynamic layout that leads the eye across the page and arouses interest.

### Authentic imagery: Video & photo shoot

A major challenge in **web design for the dental industry** is avoiding clichéd stock photos. We coordinated a professional video and photo shoot directly in the Vogel Dental laboratory.

This resulted in authentic insights that visualize the passion, precision and philosophy of the company and create trust. We also relied on the AI-supported solution for uniform employee photos that can be expanded at any time, making [it easy to create new dental technician portraits yourself](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/mitarbeiter-fotos.html).

### Content strategy and SEO-optimized content

The content was redesigned from scratch. We created targeted and **SEO-optimized content** that focuses on the benefits for dentists (full service, quality) and the needs of patients (information, contact). By reducing the number of strategic pages from over 20 to just 4, complexity was massively reduced and user navigation optimized.

### Technical development, go-live and support

As experienced **Squarespace web designers** , we used the strengths of the platform for flexible and efficient **website development**. We solved a particular challenge, such as the integration of different video formats, with clever CSS to guarantee a perfect display on all devices. The go-live took place just in time for an important industry symposium.

## What results does a new website for a dental laboratory achieve?

The new **homepage for Vogel Dentaltechnik** is more than just a digital business card - it is a strategic tool that delivers measurable success:


*  **Increase in dwell time (start page):** +300 % (from 20s to 1min 20s)
  

*  **Increase in dwell time (total):** +70% (from 50s to 85s)
  

*  **Reduction in complexity:** number of pages reduced from approx. 20 to 4

The final *design*. It's worth seeing...
