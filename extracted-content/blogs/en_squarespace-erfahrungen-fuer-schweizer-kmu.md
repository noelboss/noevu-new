## What is your experience as a web design agency with Squarespace?

Our many years of experience show that the platform offers the optimal solution for many Swiss SMEs. Our job as a digital partner is not to reinvent the wheel every time, but to choose the best technological foundation for your digital success. Squarespace offers an incredibly stable, secure and high-performance basis. Hosting, security updates and basic technical maintenance are all taken care of for you.

This is how we create a solid **digital foundation for traditional trades** , such as our [website project for a **Zurich flooring company**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/neue-webseite-fuer-bodenleger.html) , or an absolutely trustworthy and secure platform for sensitive industries, such as for the law firm Davatz Legal AG. [**Davatz Legal AG law firm**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/neue-webseite-fuer-schweizer-anwaltskanzlei-in-zuerich.html). This means for you: You can concentrate fully on your core business. For us, this means that we can invest our energy in the strategic aspects of your website instead of spending countless hours on maintenance.


## What design experience have you had with Squarespace?

A widespread prejudice is: "Squarespace pages all look the same." That's not true - or at least not if you only work within the framework of the templates. For us as **Squarespace experts**, however, these templates are just the starting point - the foundation on which we build your individual digital home. A good example of this is our own website noevu.ch - its design goes far beyond the natural limits of Squarespace designs.

The real magic begins where the standard settings end. Through the targeted use of CSS, we can adapt every design element to your corporate identity. For [**Vogel Dentaltechnik GmbH**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/modernes-webdesign-fuer-innovative-zahntechniker-das-projekt-vogel-dental) for example, we have created a modern, innovative web design that reflects the technological expertise of the dental technology laboratory and is enhanced with high-quality photos and videos.

For **rrevival**, the focus was on translating a fresh, modern brand into an equally engaging digital experience. To build a complete online identity from the ground up, Squarespace was supplemented with custom code for perfect design precision. AI-powered imagery was also used, allowing the team to create brand-loyal visuals themselves. This shows that Squarespace is not only suitable for simple websites, but can also serve as the basis for complex brand presences with innovative technologies.

## Doesn't Squarespace quickly reach its technical limits?

That is the crucial question. Yes, if you only rely on the built-in functions, there are limits. But these limits are not the end of the road. With user-defined code, these can be specifically extended.

!\[Squarespace experience with individual code customization\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/fac4584f-fb1b-4990-91a0-efd54733a4f9/Arc-Discover+Switzerland+now+with+the+Segway+-+mobileo+GmbH-Screenshot-2025-08-26-16-43-31.png)

An excellent example of this is our project with [**mobileo GmbH**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/premium-webdesign-fuer-schweizer-tourismus-unternehmen-mit-strategischer-neuausrichtung-und-squarespace-zum-buchungserfolg). Mobileo, a leading provider of Segway tours, needed a new website that not only showcased their offering effectively, but also ensured ease of use for their team. The challenge was an outdated website that was not effectively motivating bookings. Our solution was a completely new digital experience platform on Squarespace. We did not simply adapt a standard theme, but implemented a customized design. Of particular note are the customized tour filters, inspired by platforms such as Airbnb, and a custom-built importer for existing tours. These extensions, which go beyond the native Squarespace functions, were realized through targeted custom code and enabled intuitive navigation and a powerful filter that guides visitors specifically to their desired tour. In addition, a multilingual solution (DE, FR, EN) was implemented, which is essential for the Swiss market.


## Is Squarespace suitable for e-commerce and bookings in Switzerland?

Absolutely. Squarespace Commerce is a powerful solution for many Swiss SMEs. The connection to common payment providers such as Stripe and PayPal works smoothly. Our **experience with Squarespace** in e-commerce, especially with the [project for **Weinbau Wetli**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/professionelles-webdesign-fuer-weingut-am-zuerichsee-die-neue-squarespace-webseite-von-weinbau-wetli), shows the potential for product sales:

!\[Squarespace experience with individual code customization\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/a52a7f0f-fe7a-494c-abe9-7c9edde068c6/26e7fd66f7c0ede20699a7ffcec87bc2b2b34ea0afffff209db9e3219c6a50b3.png)

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/32105a2d-4992-4cbf-9058-162aa1c18d51/Squarespace+Erfahrung+mit+individuellen+Code+Anpassungen)

The winery needed a shopping experience that would do justice to the quality of their wines, including the ability to sell wine on account - a feature that Squarespace does not offer as standard. We developed a customized checkout process for this. We also implemented individual product filters by grape variety, award and availability, a visual availability indicator with bottle icons and a dynamic awards table for centralized management of awards. These specific adaptations show how Squarespace can be expanded into a highly functional e-commerce platform for special requirements through targeted extensions and custom code.


## What is our SEO experience with Squarespace websites in Switzerland?

A beautiful website that nobody can find is of no use to your business. Our clear experience is: **Squarespace offers an excellent technical SEO foundation.** All the important basics such as fast loading times, mobile optimization and clean sitemaps are available out of the box.

However, technology is only half the battle. The real SEO success comes from a well thought-out strategy. At [**Wohnperspektive GmbH**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-sozialbetrieb.html) we have targeted the content and structure of the site to relevant search terms for Swiss tourism, which has led to more visibility and bookings. For our own website  , the focus is on local search terms in order to be found in a competitive Zurich market. The result is websites that not only look good, but are also found on Google and generate qualified inquiries. Users also receive practical AI functions that make creating alt texts and meta descriptions for SEO quick and easy.

Technical measures such as SSL encryption and setting up 301 redirects are crucial for a smooth transition from an old website to a new one. The latter ensure that old URLs are redirected to the new pages to avoid the loss of SEO rankings. Integration with Google Search Console and Google Analytics also allows you to continuously monitor and optimize the performance of your website.

!\[Squarespace experience with SEO\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/ec3bbe28-a77c-4bb3-a8bc-c975b770f9c4/Arc-SE+Ranking-Screenshot-2025-08-26-16-50-23.png)

With the tools of Squarespace and some individualized functions, we achieve very good results for [noevu.ch](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en.html) within a few weeks after the relaunch.


## How easy is it for you to use Squarespace in everyday life?

A website lives and evolves. That's why it's crucial that you can maintain your site easily and independently after it goes live. This is precisely one of Squarespace's greatest strengths. The intuitive "Fluid Engine" editor makes it easy for you to update content.

For the [**NGO "Future for Kibambili"**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-schweizer-ngo-vereine.html) this point is essential. It is often volunteers or changing employees who maintain the website. Thanks to the ease of use, they can present new projects, launch appeals for donations and keep the community up to date without any prior technical knowledge. This independence not only saves time and money, but also gives you the flexibility to act quickly and independently.


## What experiences have you had with the security and performance of Squarespace?

Website security is an important aspect. [Davatz Legal AG, a **Zurich law firm**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/sichere-und-vertrauensvolle-webseite-fuer-die-zuercher-anwaltskanzlei-davatz-legal), approached us with its existing website, which offered potential for optimization in a number of areas, including SSL encryption. This allowed us to further strengthen the trust of our clients.

Squarespace itself attaches great importance to security and data protection. The platform is monitored around the clock, meets international data protection standards such as the GDPR and offers protective measures such as SSL encryption, protection against denial-of-service attacks, two-factor authentication and a Security Operations Center. Payment data is processed exclusively by the payment providers, not by Squarespace itself.

As a Swiss Squarespace Gold Partner, we were able to focus entirely on the strategic implementation, design and user-friendliness, as Squarespace guarantees a high level of security and stability by design. The result is a new homepage that radiates seriousness and is robust and secure at the same time. This shows how Squarespace creates a reliable and secure foundation for sensitive industries.

Another example of the importance of security and performance is our project with [Unitas Services GmbH, a](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma.html) Zurich-based security company [.](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma.html) [**Zurich-based security company**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/professionelle-squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma). They needed a professional online presence from the ground up. The platform developed on Squarespace not only served as a marketing and sales tool, but also delivered measurable results, such as a 192% increase in monthly website visitors and a 294% increase in average time spent on the homepage. This underlines that a secure and performant Squarespace website not only builds trust, but also contributes directly to business success.

Our Squarespace experience shows that the platform is an excellent choice for Swiss SMEs and organizations that need a secure, performant and SEO-friendly website that is easy to manage and delivers measurable results.


## For which type of Swiss company is Squarespace most worthwhile?

Our customers' experiences reflect the core benefits that Squarespace offers Swiss SMEs: ease of use, high design quality, low maintenance and the ability to meet individual requirements through targeted customizations and integrations. Whether it's template customization, CSS customization, checkout customization using JavaScript (as with Weinbau Wetli), custom filters (as with mobileo) or go-live support - our Squarespace experience enables us to provide you with a solution that not only looks good, but also works and drives your business forward.


## What is the difference between "do it yourself" and a Squarespace agency with a lot of experience?

At [**Wohnperspektive GmbH**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-sozialbetrieb.html) we have targeted the content and structure of the site to relevant search terms for Swiss tourism, which has led to more visibility and bookings. For our own website  , the focus is on local search terms in order to be found in a competitive Zurich market. The result is websites that not only look good, but are also found on Google and generate qualified inquiries. Users also receive practical AI functions that make creating alt texts and meta descriptions for SEO quick and easy.

Technical measures such as SSL encryption and setting up 301 redirects are crucial for a smooth transition from an old website to a new one. The latter ensure that old URLs are redirected to the new pages to avoid the loss of SEO rankings. Integration with Google Search Console and Google Analytics also allows you to continuously monitor and optimize the performance of your website.

With the tools of Squarespace and some individualized functions, we achieve very good results for [noevu.ch](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en.html) within a few weeks after the relaunch.


## How easy is it for you to use Squarespace in everyday life?

A website lives and evolves. That's why it's crucial that you can maintain your site easily and independently after it goes live. This is precisely one of Squarespace's greatest strengths. The intuitive "Fluid Engine" editor makes it easy for you to update content.

For the [**NGO "Future for Kibambili"**](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-schweizer-ngo-vereine.html) this point is essential. It is often volunteers or changing employees who maintain the website. Thanks to the ease of use, they can present new projects, launch appeals for donations and keep the community up to date without any prior technical knowledge. This independence not only saves time and money, but also gives you the flexibility to act quickly and independently.


## What experiences have you had with the security and performance of Squarespace?

Website security is an important aspect. [Davatz Legal AG, a **Zurich law firm**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/sichere-und-vertrauensvolle-webseite-fuer-die-zuercher-anwaltskanzlei-davatz-legal), approached us with its existing website, which offered potential for optimization in a number of areas, including SSL encryption. This allowed us to further strengthen the trust of our clients.

Squarespace itself attaches great importance to security and data protection. The platform is monitored around the clock, meets international data protection standards such as the GDPR and offers protective measures such as SSL encryption, protection against denial-of-service attacks, two-factor authentication and a Security Operations Center. Payment data is processed exclusively by the payment providers, not by Squarespace itself.

As a Swiss Squarespace Gold Partner, we were able to focus entirely on the strategic implementation, design and user-friendliness, as Squarespace guarantees a high level of security and stability by design. The result is a new homepage that radiates seriousness and is robust and secure at the same time. This shows how Squarespace creates a reliable and secure foundation for sensitive industries.

Another example of the importance of security and performance is our project with [Unitas Services GmbH, a](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma.html) Zurich-based security company [.](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/blog/squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma.html) [**Zurich-based security company**](http://noevu.ch/en/blog/professionelle-squarespace-webseite-fuer-zuercher-sicherheitsfirma). They needed a professional online presence from the ground up. The platform developed on Squarespace not only served as a marketing and sales tool, but also delivered measurable results, such as a 192% increase in monthly website visitors and a 294% increase in average time spent on the homepage. This underlines that a secure and performant Squarespace website not only builds trust, but also contributes directly to business success.

Our Squarespace experience shows that the platform is an excellent choice for Swiss SMEs and organizations that need a secure, performant and SEO-friendly website that is easy to manage and delivers measurable results.
