#### When Unitas Services GmbH, an established Swiss provider in the event and security industry, approached us, they had a clear vision but no digital business card. The challenge was to create a professional online presence from scratch that not only reflected their wide range of services, but also targeted new customers and qualified employees. As an experienced [Swiss Squarespace web designer](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespcae-webdesign.html) and partner for strategic [website development](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-webdesign.html), we were able to accompany this exciting project from conception to successful launch.

* * *


## The challenge - no presence yet

Unitas Services GmbH was faced with the task of transforming the reputation and expertise it had built up over the years into a digital strategy. Without an existing website, it was difficult to take advantage of new business opportunities online. 


## The solution: Strategic web design & development

Our approach as **Swiss Squarespace experts** goes far beyond pure design. We have pursued a holistic process based on four critical success factors: Message, Usability, Design and Operations.

### 1\. create a foundation (message & usability):

We laid the foundations together in an intensive **user experience workshop** . Using the "Golden Circle" model, we defined the "why, how and what" of Unitas in order to work out the company's unique passion and personal approach. Building on this, we developed precise personas (e.g. the event planner, the production manager, the applicant) and their customer journeys in order to perfectly align the **website development** with user needs.

!\[Image\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/28340617-da59-44d3-92b0-4cd9f589c280/95606a9ea16a1e7f945ef4ace1fe25b17352e438e99741b9a74f547d6fc6f7dc.png)


### 2\. three interactive design prototypes

Instead of static drafts, we presented three interactive design prototypes directly in Squarespace. This allowed the client to experience the future website live and make an informed decision.


### The Secure Circle

Focuses on human warmth, using warm colors and serif fonts like Adonis and Roboto, surrounded by a bright ribbon that symbolizes safety and creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere.


### The Elegant

Conveys subtle elegance and combines soft beige and precious gold tones with the clear lines of the Oswald and Arimo fonts to create an atmosphere of discreet luxury and refined sophistication.


### The Futuristic

Goes for a striking and modern style. It uses dark tones and neon-lit accents with the Abel and Source Code Pro fonts to create a progressive and technology-oriented, slightly playful atmosphere.


* * *


### 3\. forward-looking visual language - AI-supported visual communication

As there was little visual material available at the beginning, we created a customized and consistent AI imagery for Unitas Services. This guaranteed a professional and flexible visual language that fits the brand perfectly - and more cost-effectively than any stock photo subscription or shoot. 


*  **Unique AI Image World:** We developed a ChatGPT-based prompt system that generates brand-compliant instructions for image creation.
  

*  **Unique visuals:** All images were created with Ideogram.ai using a specific color and light composition that perfectly matches the corporate identity.
  

*  **Flexibility for the customer:** With this system, Unitas can independently create high-quality AI images for future content in the long term.


## The result is convincing

As Swiss Squarespace experts, we have created far more than just a website for Unitas Services GmbH. The result is a holistic digital platform that serves as a powerful marketing and sales tool and delivers measurable success.


*  **A modern and scalable website:** The core of the project is a professional, user-friendly and future-proof website developed on Squarespace. It is designed to grow with the company and easily integrate new business areas such as the "Academy & Careers". The website presents Unitas Services as a competent and approachable partner in the security and event industry.
  

*  **Integrated marketing tools:** The platform has been equipped with targeted lead generation functions, including:
  
  *  Efficient application and contact forms to simplify user interaction.
  
  *  A customized, AI-generated visual world that ensures a consistent and cost-efficient visual identity.
  
  *  A user-friendly content management system (CMS) that enables the Unitas team to maintain content independently.
  

*  **Measurable success in figures:** The launch of the new website led to immediate and impressive results:
  
  *  The number of monthly website visitors rose by **192%** in just three months.
  
  *  The average time spent on the homepage increased by **294%**, from 33 seconds to over two minutes.
  

### **A satisfied partner**

The most important result is a customer whose expectations were exceeded. The project was praised as "mega professional", which strengthens the trust in a long-term partnership.

> ### "Mega professional and never experienced before. The collaboration with Noel and the Noevu team was strategic, transparent and extremely efficient from the very beginning. We didn't just get a website, but a powerful tool that represents our brand perfectly and helps us grow."

> Marco Nünlist, Managing Director - Unitas Services GmbH
