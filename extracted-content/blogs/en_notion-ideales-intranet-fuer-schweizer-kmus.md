## The smart solution for small companies: Notion as an intranet

In today's digital world, it's essential for small businesses to optimize their websites to stay competitive. But how can a company ensure that all employees are up to date and working together smoothly? One solution could be an intranet, an internal website that facilitates the exchange of information within the company. **Notion is one such platform that is particularly suitable for Swiss SMEs as an efficient intranet.**
