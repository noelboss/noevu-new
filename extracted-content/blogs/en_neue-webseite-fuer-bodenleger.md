#### Your craftsmanship is first-class, your work precise and your customers are satisfied. But you are barely visible online and your website is not generating any inquiries. Many excellent Swiss craft businesses face this challenge: their digital presence is outdated and does not reflect the high quality of their services. Today, a professional website is no longer a luxury, but the digital foundation that creates trust, showcases your expertise and constantly generates new orders. This is exactly where we come in.


## Most important information on websites for craftsmen


*  **More visibility & orders:** A **new homepage for Swiss craftsmen** makes you visible to customers on Google and generates constant inquiries.
  

*  **Professional impression:** Show off your first-class work with a modern **website for craft businesses** and immediately create trust with potential customers.
  

*  **Clear process, transparent costs:** When you **have** a **craftsman website created**, you benefit from a predictable process and a worthwhile investment.
  

*  **Future-proof & easy to maintain:** Your new website is technically modern, secure and so easy to use that you can customize content yourself.
  

## What is a craftsman website and why is it so important?

A craftsman website is much more than just a digital brochure. It is your central marketing tool, your virtual showroom and your strongest sales agent. For **tradespeople in Switzerland** , it is the most effective way to demonstrate expertise, showcase completed projects and build trust with potential clients. At a time when the first search for a service provider almost always begins online, a professional **online presence for tradespeople** determines whether you are even considered for a contract.


## How do you create a successful craftsman website?

The creation of a successful website follows a clear plan. Start with the strategy: define your goals and your target group. Do you primarily want to generate new inquiries or present your portfolio? Then it's about the **web design for craftsmen** , which must reflect your brand identity and ensure intuitive user guidance. Finally, the content is crucial: present your services clearly and comprehensibly and showcase your best work. If you want to **have** a **craftsman website created**, make sure that the agency understands your trade.


## What functions should a craftsman website have?

To convince customers, your website needs certain key functions:

A **professional homepage for floor layers in Switzerland** is characterized by three key points:


*  **Trust and credibility:** It shows authentic pictures of your work, introduces the team and makes your values - such as quality, cleanliness and honesty - digitally tangible. Before and after galleries or videos of the construction site immediately create trust.
  

*  **Clear user guidance and conversion:** Visitors find what they are looking for intuitively. Your services are presented in an understandable way and clearly formulated calls to action lead the user to make contact or request a quote.
  

*  **Technical excellence and visibility:** The site loads quickly, is optimized for all mobile devices (mobile-first) and is technically clean for search engines such as Google. This is the only way to ensure that you will actually be found in your region.
  

## What content belongs on a successful craftsman website?

To convince visitors, your website must convey the right information quickly and clearly. First define what your customers need to know before they contact you.

**Important contents at a glance:**


*  **Service overview:** Describe clearly and comprehensibly what services you offer (e.g. laying parquet, carpet cleaning, vinyl flooring).
  

*  **Project gallery:** Show your best work with high-quality pictures or videos. Before and after comparisons are particularly effective.
  

*  **About us page:** Introduce your team and your company history. This creates personality and closeness.
  

*  **Customer testimonials:** Real reviews from satisfied customers are the best proof of your quality.
  

*  **Easy to contact:** A clearly visible telephone number, a simple contact form and your address are essential.
  

## How does the process work if you want to have a craftsman website created?

A structured and transparent process is crucial for creating your new website efficiently and purposefully. Instead of relying on standard templates, at Noevu we design customized digital experiences that fit your business, your values and your goals.

Our tried-and-tested approach, illustrated by the project with Fennerboden:


*  **Analysis, concept and workshop:** Every successful project starts with listening. We sharpen your core message in a joint online workshop. This turns the website into a strategic tool.
  

*  **Interactive design prototypes:** Based on your brand identity, we develop interactive design prototypes. This allows you to experience the future appearance live before development begins.
  

*  **Authentic imagery and content:** A website thrives on real images and convincing texts. We organize professional shoots and develop an SEO-optimized content strategy.
  

*  **Efficient development with Squarespace:** As Swiss Squarespace experts, we rely on modern technology. The result is a high-quality, high-performance and secure website that you can easily maintain yourself.
  

## How do you optimize your website for search engines?

Search engine optimization (SEO) ensures that customers find you on Google. The basis for **SEO for craftsman websites** is the use of relevant keywords such as "painter Zurich" or "plumbing Bern". These should appear organically in titles, texts and image descriptions. Other important factors are fast loading times, a clear page structure and high-quality, informative content that answers your potential customers' questions.


## Why is mobile design crucial for craftsmen websites?

Imagine a potential customer standing on a building site and urgently looking for an electrician on their smartphone. If your website is illegible or difficult to use on a small screen, they will leave immediately. A responsive design that automatically adapts to any screen size is therefore not an optional extra, but an absolute necessity. Google favors mobile-friendly sites in its rankings, which further underlines the importance.


## How do you integrate customer reviews and references?

Customer reviews are digital gold. They create social trust (social proof) and often tip the scales when it comes to awarding contracts. Actively ask satisfied customers for a review on Google or directly for your website. Present these testimonials prominently on the homepage or on a dedicated reference page. Combine short quotes with project images to achieve maximum impact.


## What legal aspects do you need to consider?

Legal framework conditions also apply to a **website for small craft businesses** in Switzerland. A complete legal notice (with name, address and contact information) and a privacy policy that explains how you handle personal data in accordance with the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG) are essential. To be on the safe side, a legal check is recommended.


## How can you link your website to social media?

Social media such as Instagram, Facebook or LinkedIn are ideal channels for presenting your craft visually and building a community. Link from your website to your social media profiles and vice versa. Use these channels to provide insights into your day-to-day work, present new projects and drive traffic to your website, where the final inquiry can be made.


## How do you use local SEO for more visibility?

For most craft businesses, customers from the local area are the most important. **Local SEO for tradespeople** is the key to reaching precisely this target group. The most important step is to set up and maintain a free Google Business Profile. Make sure your business details (name, address, phone number) are consistent across all platforms and collect positive Google reviews.


## What content should not be missing on your craftsman website?

The content is the heart of your website. In addition to the functions already mentioned, the following content is crucial:


*  **Clear service descriptions:** What exactly do you offer? Explain it simply and clearly.
  

*  **Unique value proposition (USP):** What makes you better than the competition? Specialization, tradition, special materials?
  

*  **A blog or guide:** share your expertise. Articles with **tips for craftsmen websites** or instructions position you as an expert.
  

## How do you measure the success of your craftsman website?

To understand the benefits of your website, you need to measure its success. You can use free tools such as Google Analytics to collect important key figures: How many visitors come to your site? Which channels do they use to find you? How many fill out the contact form? This data will help you to optimize your online strategy and understand the return on investment of your website.


## What are the costs for a new website for craftsmen in Switzerland?

The costs are a direct investment in the future of your company. A cheap website that brings in no customers is more expensive than a professional solution that finances itself through new orders. So the question is not just what it costs, but what it earns you.

The investment depends on factors such as the number of pages, functions and design complexity. At Noevu, we focus on absolute transparency: you receive a clear quote with no hidden costs before the project starts. For Fennerboden, this has been a worthwhile investment that pays off with more qualified inquiries every month.


## Practical example: Fennerboden from Zurich


### The customer & the challenge

For Roger Fenner of fenner boden, an established Zurich-based flooring company, we were asked to create a new, modern website based on Squarespace. The challenge was to translate the deeply rooted values such as quality, honesty and personal service into a digital experience. As a Swiss premium Squarespace web designer, we developed a solution that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also generates targeted new customer inquiries and strengthens the company's unique positioning in the market.

Roger Fenner and his team put their heart and soul into honest craftsmanship. However, their previous website no longer lived up to this claim. It lacked a modern, clear structure that made the trust and high quality of their work tangible online and encouraged potential customers to get in touch.

*  The solution had to be future-proof, low-maintenance and easy for the Fennerboden team to maintain.

## Our **approach** to implementation


### 1\. analysis, concept and workshop

Every successful project starts with listening. In a joint online workshop, we took a deep dive into the world of Fennerboden. Using the "Golden Circle" principle (Why, How, What), we sharpened the core message. We defined clear target group personas and analyzed their customer journey to ensure that every visitor is guided intuitively and purposefully through the site.

### 2\. interactive **design prototypes** instead of standard themes

At Noevu, we don't adapt templates - we design individual experiences. Based on the new, authentic imagery, we developed several interactive design prototypes. This allowed the team to experience the future look and feel and give feedback before the first line of code was written. This process guarantees that the end result corresponds exactly to the ideas and strategic goals.


### Design prototype 1

Close to the original design with classic blue colors and angular shapes.


### Design prototype 2

A new, modern and fresh version based on current trends was the customer's choice.


* * *


### 3\. authentic visual worlds: **Photo and video production**

A website thrives on authentic images. To make the personality and craftsmanship of Fennerboden real and tangible, we worked with the talented photographer and videographer **Marco Bähni**. In a professional shoot, we put Roger Fenner and his team in the perfect light. The result is high-quality photos and videos that not only create trust, but also show the passion and people behind the craft.


### 4\. efficient **development with Squarespace**

As a **Swiss Squarespace expert and Gold Partner**, we rely on state-of-the-art SaaS technology. We chose Squarespace because the platform allows us to focus all our energy on strategy, usability and outstanding design. The result is a high-quality, high-performance and secure website that has been realized efficiently.


### 5\. launch, operation and **continuous support**

Our work is not done after the smooth launch. Fennerboden benefits from a service package that includes hosting, security and support hours. This gives you cost security and the certainty that your digital presence will be continuously managed and optimized by a **professional web designer**.


## Result and conclusion:


### A digital flagship that impresses

Anyone who wants to **have a new website created** for their company is looking for a partner who understands their own identity and makes it digitally visible. This is exactly what we achieved for Fennerboden. The new website is an authentic, digital flagship. Supported by professional photos and videos by Marco Bähni, it perfectly conveys the company's core values - quality, trust and pride in craftsmanship - and makes the team behind it approachable. It is not only modern and user-friendly, but also an effective tool for acquiring new customers.

*  ### How long does it take to create a craftsman website? 

  
  A simple website project can be realized in a few weeks. For larger projects with individual conception, text creation and SEO optimization, you should expect one to three months. Good planning and your active participation can speed up the process. At Noevu, we use clear, structured project phases so that you can go online quickly and predictably and always know where we stand.
  

*  ### What does a professional homepage cost me as a floor layer in Switzerland? 

  
  A professional website is a sustainable investment in your marketing and starts at around CHF 5,000. The exact price depends on the number of pages, desired functions and the individual design. We will provide you with a transparent and binding quote tailored precisely to your needs before the launch.
  

*  ### Do I need technical know-how to maintain the website? 

  
  Not at all. We build your website on a modern and user-friendly content management system (CMS) such as Squarespace. This allows you to easily adapt content such as texts, images or new projects yourself. We provide you with clear video instructions or take over the maintenance completely for you if required.
  

*  ### Will my new website appear on Google and in regional searches? 

  
  Yes, absolutely. We lay the technical and content-related SEO foundation during creation. This includes researching the right keywords, structured data, fast loading times and a mobile-friendly presentation. This is how Noevu ensures that you can be found online in your region and attract the right customers.
  

*  ### Can I create my craftsman website myself? 

  
  Yes, it is technically possible to create a website yourself with modular systems. However, a professional, SEO-optimized and legally compliant website requires a lot of expertise in the areas of design, user guidance, text and technology. A specialized agency can help you avoid typical mistakes and exploit the maximum potential.

For Roger Fenner of fenner boden, an established Zurich-based flooring company, we were asked to create a new, modern website based on Squarespace.

### 2\. interactive **design prototypes** instead of standard themes

At Noevu, we don't adapt templates - we design individual experiences. Based on the new, authentic imagery, we developed several interactive design prototypes. This allowed the team to experience the future look and feel and give feedback before the first line of code was written. This process guarantees that the end result corresponds exactly to the ideas and strategic goals.


### Design prototype 1

Close to the original design with classic blue colors and angular shapes.


### Design prototype 2

A new, modern and fresh version based on current trends was the customer's choice.

### 3\. authentic visual worlds: **Photo and video production**

A website thrives on authentic images. To make the personality and craftsmanship of Fennerboden real and tangible, we worked with the talented photographer and videographer **Marco Bähni**. In a professional shoot, we put Roger Fenner and his team in the perfect light. The result is high-quality photos and videos that not only create trust, but also show the passion and people behind the craft.


### 4\. efficient **development with Squarespace**

As a **Swiss Squarespace expert and Gold Partner**, we rely on state-of-the-art SaaS technology. We chose Squarespace because the platform allows us to focus all our energy on strategy, usability and outstanding design. The result is a high-quality, high-performance and secure website that has been realized efficiently.


### 5\. launch, operation and **continuous support**

Our work is not done after the smooth launch. Fennerboden benefits from a service package that includes hosting, security and support hours. This gives you cost security and the certainty that your digital presence will be continuously managed and optimized by a **professional web designer**.


## Result and conclusion:


### A digital flagship that impresses

Anyone who wants to **have a new website created** for their company is looking for a partner who understands their own identity and makes it digitally visible. This is exactly what we achieved for Fennerboden. The new website is an authentic, digital flagship. Supported by professional photos and videos by Marco Bähni, it perfectly conveys the company's core values - quality, trust and pride in craftsmanship - and makes the team behind it approachable. It is not only modern and user-friendly, but also an effective tool for acquiring new customers.

*  ### How long does it take to create a craftsman website? 

  
  A simple website project can be realized in a few weeks. For larger projects with individual conception, text creation and SEO optimization, you should expect one to three months. Good planning and your active participation can speed up the process. At Noevu, we use clear, structured project phases so that you can go online quickly and predictably and always know where we stand.
  

*  ### What does a professional homepage cost me as a floor layer in Switzerland? 

  
  A professional website is a sustainable investment in your marketing and starts at around CHF 5,000. The exact price depends on the number of pages, desired functions and the individual design. We will provide you with a transparent and binding quote tailored precisely to your needs before the launch.
  

*  ### Do I need technical know-how to maintain the website? 

  
  Not at all. We build your website on a modern and user-friendly content management system (CMS) such as Squarespace. This allows you to easily adapt content such as texts, images or new projects yourself. We provide you with clear video instructions or take over the maintenance completely for you if required.
  

*  ### Will my new website appear on Google and in regional searches? 

  
  Yes, absolutely. We lay the technical and content-related SEO foundation during creation. This includes researching the right keywords, structured data, fast loading times and a mobile-friendly presentation. This is how Noevu ensures that you can be found online in your region and attract the right customers.
  

*  ### Can I create my craftsman website myself? 

  
  Yes, it is technically possible to create a website yourself with modular systems. However, a professional, SEO-optimized and legally compliant website requires a lot of expertise in the areas of design, user guidance, text and technology. A specialized agency can help you avoid typical mistakes and exploit the maximum potential.

[Noel Bossart](https://noevu.ch/en/blog?author=645cda2b73efc12ab508fb2e)It is often a challenge for Swiss SMEs to operate a modern and effective website.

My goal is to support Swiss SMEs with modern, customer-centric digital solutions of the highest quality thanks to smart tools and efficient processes - at a price that remains affordable for SMEs.  

With over 25 years of experience in web design, marketing and digital strategy, I help create online presences that not only look good, but also deliver results.
