## A new homepage for a Swiss law firm


#### The redesign was prompted by a technical warning message that was displayed in the browser when the website was accessed, indicating a lack of SSL encryption. This served as a welcome impulse to not only update the technical foundation of the site, but also to modernize the design and user guidance.

Although the previous website was structured and clearly laid out, it was a little outdated. Together, we developed a new website for the law firm that reflects the firm's personality - approachable, professional and to the point. The new website conveys the firm's values and expertise and helps potential clients to find their way around quickly and intuitively.


## The client & the challenge: An insecure platform undermines client trust

For us, a website is more than just code and design; it is the heart of your digital communication. That's why we took the technical problem as an opportunity to take a step back together with Davatz Legal and ask the crucial questions. The task was clear: we didn't just need a new, **beautiful website**. It needed a digital foundation that exudes seriousness, gets to the heart of the law firm's unique positioning and is equipped for future growth.


### Customer


*  [Davatz Legal AG](https://davatzlegal.ch/), an established law firm in the heart of Zurich.
  

*  Specialized in inheritance, family, corporate and contract law.
  

*  Trademark: Personal, pragmatic and solution-oriented legal advice at eye level.


### Project


*  Strategic website consulting & workshop
  

*  Individual, confidence-building web design
  

*  **Website development** on Squarespace
  

*  Professional multilingualism (DE/EN)
  

*  Technical and content-related SEO basics
  

*  Training and handover of the system
  

*  Ongoing support & optimization


### Special features


*  The initial situation was a website with serious technical deficiencies (SSL error).
  

*  The existing system was outdated and no longer supported.
  

*  The digital presence reflected neither the firm's expertise nor its approachable approach.


## **Analysis** and **concept**: the foundation for success

It all starts with the "why". In an intensive workshop, we worked with the Davatz Legal team to uncover the core of the brand. Using methods such as the Golden Circle, we defined the strategic guard rail that guided every subsequent decision. The aim was to translate the law firm's unique, approachable attitude into a clear digital message.


## Individual **design**: seriousness meets approachability

We do not customize standard themes but develop an individual web design for each customer. Based on the developed strategy, our professional web designers developed several interactive live prototypes. This allowed the Davatz Legal team to experience the future site first-hand and provide well-founded feedback. Requests such as a fixed header or a specific arrangement of the team page were implemented directly and efficiently, making the design process extremely agile.

## Efficient **website development** with a focus on added value

As a **Swiss Squarespace Gold Partner** , we rely on a platform that offers you security, stability and simplicity. Instead of investing energy in complex technical maintenance, we were able to concentrate fully on strategic implementation, design and usability. The result is a **website for lawyers with a focus on inheritance law** that not only looks professional, but is also robust and secure at its core.


## Expanded and revised **content** that convinces.

The services, from matrimonial and inheritance law to corporate law, are presented clearly and comprehensibly. We have created a structure that allows visitors to quickly find the relevant information. We have thus created a perfect basis for increasing the firm's visibility in the future with **SEO-optimized content** and underlining its expertise.


## Website launch and continuous **optimization**

The go-live was a complete success and was enthusiastically received by the team. But this is where our work really begins. We took the site live with a clean SEO structure and are constantly improving it as part of our service package. The service hours included in the package ensure that the site is always up to date and continuously optimized for the best results. This gives you cost security and the certainty of having an experienced partner at your side.


## The result: a new website for lawyers that creates trust and wins clients

The result is a modern, fast website that works perfectly on all devices and authentically conveys Davatz Legal's core values. The transformation from an error-prone site to a trustworthy digital flagship is unmistakable. The new online presence forms the ideal basis for future measures such as the creation of **SEO-optimized content** and sustainably strengthens the position of the law firm in Zurich as an **SBA inheritance law specialist** and expert in inheritance and family law as well as corporate law.

This is how good the new law firm website looks:
