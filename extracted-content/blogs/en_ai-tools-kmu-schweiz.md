## 11 AI-integrated browsers: **Intelligent surfing** and working

!\[DIA Browser with integrated AI - Useful for Swiss SMEs\](file:///Users/Noel\_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/images/2e176524-62d6-4ba0-ade0-b37a2eedea50/DIA+Browser+mit+integrierter+AI+%E2%80%93+N%C3%BCtzlich+f%C3%BCr+Schweizer+KMU)

Modern web browsers such as Microsoft Edge and the innovative Dia Browser[(free invite](https://diabrowser.com/invite/N4PAUI)) are increasingly integrating AI features to boost productivity, increase security and optimize workflows for businesses. These AI assistants are embedded directly into the browser environment and offer a new dimension of intelligent surfing and working.

**What it brings you:** AI-integrated browsers offer a wide range of functions. Microsoft Edge for Business, for example, integrates Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat Enterprise), an AI assistant with commercial privacy that can summarize web pages, help with research and generate drafts. Dia Browser, developed by The Browser Company, uses the URL bar as a chatbot input field to interact with AI, summarize content, draft text and automate tasks. Both browsers offer contextual responses based on the content of open tabs and enable the automation of routine tasks by "skills" or AI agents.

**Why you should use it:** For Swiss SMEs that want to optimize their online workflows and benefit from intelligent assistance functions, AI-integrated browsers are a valuable addition. They enable employees to process information faster, create content more efficiently and automate repetitive tasks directly in the browser. The focus on data protection and integration into existing corporate environments (such as Microsoft 365 with Edge) make them a secure and productive choice.

**What you could use it for:**


*  **Increased productivity:** Quick summaries, research support and draft creation directly in the browser.
  

*  **Automation of tasks:** Creation of "skills" or AI agents to automate repetitive work processes.
  

*  **Contextual intelligence:** AI understands the content of open tabs and provides relevant answers and suggestions.
