#### As a strategic partner and Swiss Squarespace expert, we were able to carry out a complete website relaunch for Finca Las Mariposas in Tenerife. The mission: to replace an outdated, error-prone WordPress site with a modern, elegant and functional website on Squarespace in just one week. This project was about more than just a new design; it was about elevating the finca's digital business card to the level of their excellent offer and optimizing booking processes.


### The customer & the challenge 

Finca Las Mariposas is an exclusive vacation resort on Tenerife with Swiss management. Its previous website no longer met this high standard and slowed down its business potential.


* * *


### Customer


*  [Finca Las Mariposas](http://fincamariposas.com/): provider of high-quality vacation apartments in the tourism sector
  

*  Focus on individual travelers looking for peace, nature and quality
  

*  Swiss management with correspondingly high standards of service and presentation


### Project scope


*  The WordPress site was technically outdated, slow and error-prone.
  

*  With its rigid, blog-like layout, the design appeared uninspired and overloaded (see comparison image). It lacked visual hierarchy and emotional depth.
  

*  Important functions such as contact forms were unreliable and led to missed requests.
  

*  A quick but sustainable solution was sought for a **new website**.


### Special features


*  An extremely ambitious time frame of just seven days for the complete relaunch.
  

*  The high aesthetic standard of digitally capturing the unique atmosphere of "peace, space, tranquillity, power" - a stark contrast to the old design.
  

*  The requirement to create a solution that can be easily managed by the customer.
  

*  **Multilingual website** with AI support


* * *


## The solution: Strategic web design & development

We decided on a strategic relaunch with Squarespace. As a leading SaaS platform, Squarespace enables extremely efficient **website development** without compromising on design and functionality. This allowed us to focus all our energy on strategy, design and usability rather than losing it in complex technical maintenance.


### 1\. analysis and concept

In an intensive start-up phase, we analyzed the weak points of the old website and defined the goals for the new website. We delved deep into the world of Finca to understand its essence. Based on this, we developed a clear content strategy for **SEO-optimized content** and planned the revision of the existing promotional video to adapt it to the new, high-quality aesthetic.


### 2\. individual design in prototyping

Instead of adapting a standard theme, we developed several interactive design prototypes that were precisely tailored to the Finca Las Mariposas brand. The focus was on a clear visual language, elegant typography and intuitive user guidance that picks up visitors emotionally and leads them to the booking.


### 3\. efficient development & content production

As a Swiss **Squarespace Gold Partner** , we implemented the final design in record time. In parallel, we recut the promotional video and provided it with a suitable soundtrack to ensure a coherent and emotional brand message. Technically, we integrated all processes on Squarespace's robust SaaS architecture, which guarantees security, speed and a perfect display on all devices. As Finca Las Mariposas welcomes guests from all over the world, the **multilingualism of** the new website was essential. We used **a** solution that **is extremely efficient** thanks to **AI-supported translations**. This made it possible to quickly translate the entire website into different languages. Guests are automatically redirected to their own language or can conveniently choose the language they feel most comfortable with. This increases user-friendliness and strengthens the global presence as a provider of vacation rentals.

### 4\. launch and operation 

After a final quality check, the new website and new video went live on schedule. But our work does not end with the launch. Thanks to the service hours included in the project, the client enjoys full cost security and benefits from our ongoing support. As his **Swiss Squarespace developer**, we are constantly optimizing the site and are available for any concerns.


## Result and conclusion

The result is a website that is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also serves as a powerful lead generation tool. The shift from a cluttered, impersonal blog layout to an immersive, elegant brand experience is significant. Visitor numbers have increased, dwell time has increased and booking inquiries are coming in reliably thanks to the new forms. Finca now has a digital presence that reflects its quality and actively promotes the business.
