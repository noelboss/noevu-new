#### Wohnperspektive GmbH does valuable social work by supporting people in difficult circumstances. Our task was to cast this important mission in a professional, digital form. As experienced web designers and Squarespace partners in Switzerland, we were commissioned to develop a completely new website.


## The goal:

A user-friendly, clear and UX-compliant online presence that conveys the company's unique vision, creates trust and generates targeted leads. We not only created a website, but a strategic communication basis that builds on the "Golden Circle" principle and answers the question of "why" in an emotional and convincing way.


### The customer's challenge

The biggest challenge was to communicate a sensitive social issue in a professional, accessible and hopeful way. The new website had to appeal to different target groups: direct clients, but also social workers and social services as important intermediaries.


* * *


### Customer


*  [Wohnperspektive GmbH](https://wohnperspektive.ch/): A social enterprise that offers secure housing and individual support in everyday life.
  

*  Offer: Support for a self-determined, independent life and a "residential school" to promote skills.
  

*  Target groups: Clients, specialist social agencies and services that are financing partners


### Project


*  Development of a new, professional website from scratch.
  

*  Creation of a clear, user-friendly and modern **web design**.
  

*  Establishment of a complete branding including logo design.
  

*  Structured communication of the value proposition according to the "Golden Circle" principle (Why, How, What).
  

*  Design of a digital presence for the "Wohnschule".


### Special features


*  The need to build an emotional connection and convey hope.
  

*  The development of a flexible logo family that also works bilingually (DE/FR).
  

*  The clear strategic orientation not only to inform, but also to encourage people to make contact.


* * *


## The solution: Strategic web design & development

As **Swiss Squarespace developers**, we go beyond pure aesthetics. Our approach was strategic and profound. We started by sharpening the core brand message in workshops and working out the "why" of Wohnperspektive GmbH: the belief that change is possible and that everyone has the potential for a self-determined life.


### 1\. branding & logo development

At the heart of the new brand identity is the guiding principle **"Home Is Where Growth Starts"** . As a strategic partner, it was clear to us that the **branding** had to translate this idea visually. That's why we worked with renowned Swiss graphic designer and [brand expert Vincent Ghilione from Polychrome](http://www.polychrome.ch/) to realize this approach.

The result is a logo that combines warmth, security and positive development: an abstract figurative mark that merges a protective roof with an upward-pointing arrow. In combination with the elegant font "Chic Avenue" and a color palette of trusting dark blue and hopeful coral red, we created a visual identity that is professional, approachable and profound. The entire logo system was also flexibly designed for bilingualism (DE/FR) from the outset - a testament to our forward-thinking **website consultancy**.

### 2\. two paths, one goal: the **design prototypes**

Based on the defined brand strategy, we developed two different but equally well thought-out visual routes. These prototypes served as a basis for discussion in order to find the perfect tonality for the final **web design**.


#### 1st design route: "A Bright Perspective" 

This design was intended to visualize optimism and new opportunities. We used a bright and warm color palette to convey a sense of hope and a new beginning.


*  **Visual elements:** Large, wide-angle images symbolized openness and new horizons. Transparent surfaces and overlaps created depth and lightness.
  

*  **Design language:** A combination of gently rounded elements (warmth, humanity) and clear, straight lines (structure, reliability) reflected the care approach.


#### 2nd design route: "Hopeful Thoughts" 

This approach focused on building trust through an atmosphere of security and positive development.


*  **Visual elements:** Dark, calming color tones combined with strong contrasts created an intimate yet encouraging mood. The targeted use of portraits was intended to create a personal connection.
  

*  **Design language:** Rounded image shapes stood for warmth and accessibility, while angular transitions and clear grids provided structure and reliability - inspired by the potential logo symbol.


* * *


### A Bright Perspective


### Hopeful Thoughts


* * *


### 3\. innovative imagery through customized AI

To set ourselves apart from impersonal and generic stock photos, we created a unique and authentic visual world for the living perspective. Instead of resorting to expensive photo shoots, we developed a sustainable and efficient solution: a customized AI prompt system. This enables the Wohnperspektive team to create new, brand-faithful visuals of the highest quality themselves at any time.


*  **Customized prompt system:** We implemented a ChatGPT-based system that generates precise, brand-compliant instructions for AI image creation, ensuring visual consistency.
  

*  **Unique visual aesthetics:** All images follow a specific color and light composition that perfectly matches Wohnperspektive's corporate identity and creates a warm, hopeful atmosphere.
  

*  **Authentic presentation:** The images were deliberately designed to show people who are authentic and "drawn from life". This creates an honest connection to the target group and strengthens credibility.


## The result - digital excellence and market success

The result of our holistic work is far more than just a new website. We created a complete digital identity for Wohnperspektive GmbH - from strategic **branding** and user-centered **web design**to innovative imagery. This coherent and professional presence creates trust and positions the company as a leading provider in its niche.

The success speaks for itself: by consistently implementing our strategy and creating **SEO-optimized content** , Wohnperspektive GmbH has achieved an outstanding result. **After just a few months, the website ranks at the top of Google for relevant search queries in the Biel region.** This success proves how effective the combination of a profound brand strategy and technical excellence as a **Swiss Squarespace expert** is to create sustainable visibility and measurable results.

> "  The collaboration with Noevu was crucial. Noel Bossart and his team understood our vision and gave it a digital soul. The strategic, professional web design exceeded our expectations. We are perfectly represented and reach our target groups more effectively." 

\- Tom Gerber, Co-Managing Director, Wohnperspektive GmbH
