## A new homepage for a Swiss winegrower


#### Creating a first-class web design for a winery that combines tradition and modernity - that was our mission for the project for Weinbau Wetli from Lake Zurich. As [Swiss Squarespace experts](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-webdesign.html) for winegrowers, we were commissioned by Anne Grethe & Samuel Wetli-Schinzel to develop a professional website for their winery that is not only visually convincing, but also invites visitors to visit the winery and experience the fine wines in person.


## The customer & the challenge: An outdated platform

Weinbau Wetli was faced with the classic challenge of having to replace the old winery website. The existing system was technically outdated and secure operation was no longer guaranteed. It was time for a comprehensive website modernization to better present the award-winning wines online and to create a future-proof basis for the winery's marketing. A simple product list was not enough; a shopping experience was needed that would do justice to the quality of the wines and the character of the family business.


### Customer


*  **Customer:** Family business [Weinbau Wetli](https://weinbau-wetli.ch/) from Männedorf.
  

*  **Industry:** viticulture / winery, production and direct sales.
  

*  **Offer:** [Excellent quality wines](https://weinbau-wetli.ch/weine#auszeichnungen) from Lake Zurich, including innovative PiWi varieties.


### Project


*  Comprehensive website development from the ground up.
  

*  Implementation as a Squarespace website for the winery.
  

*  Premium web design that reflects the brand and the new labels
  

*  Setting up a user-friendly ordering system to sell wine online on account.
  

*  Strategic SEO optimization for better visibility in Switzerland.


### Special features


*  High expectations of the new design as a further development of the popular old appearance.
  

*  An ambitious schedule to be online in time for the Open Wine Cellar Day, one of the most important events for wineries and winegrowers.
  

*  Development of individual extensions for the presentation of awards, availability and wine characteristics.
  

*  Development of an individual solution for invoice orders that goes beyond the standard functions of Squarespace.
  

*  The need to build a bridge between tradition and a modern online store for wine.


## The solution: Strategic web design with Squarespace

We created more than just a new website for the winery. As web designers with a focus on Swiss SMEs, we developed a digital strategy. Thanks to Squarespace, we were able to keep the background work to a minimum and concentrate on convincing design and targeted functions. The site helps to promote seasonal winemaker events or tastings and improve sales both on site and digitally. Thanks to special customizations and individual code, functions were created that are otherwise not possible with Squarespace - so we developed a new website that is precisely tailored to the winery.


## Our **approach**: From strategic analysis to digital experience

An outstanding result requires a well thought-out approach. Our process was divided into clearly defined phases to ensure maximum transparency and efficiency.


### 1\. analysis, strategy & concept: the foundation for success

Thanks to close and rapid communication, we laid the foundations for the new website for the winery in a short space of time. We analyzed the goals, the target groups and the unique history of Weinbau Wetli in order to develop an authentic and effective online strategy.


### 2\. individual web design & interactive prototypes: Making the experience tangible

We develop several individual web designs instead of simply adapting rigid templates. For Weinbau Wetli, we created two customized, interactive prototypes that were specifically tailored to the client's needs and ideas. In close consultation with the Wetli family, we decided on the design direction that best visualized the down-to-earth nature and high quality of the winery and matched the brand. Thanks to Squarespace's high degree of flexibility, the Wetli family was able to exert a lot of influence on the finished design, which meant that change requests could be implemented easily and without additional costs. The result is a modern, appealing website that perfectly represents the winery and preserves its roots and authenticity. New video headers were developed and integrated in collaboration with [Nik Kutter](https://nikkutter.ch/). This allows visitors to experience the award-winning wines up close and immerse themselves in the world of winegrowing and the Wetli family.

**"Geerdete": A very approachable and authentic design that emphasizes the family atmosphere and the down-to-earth nature of Weinbau Wetli.**

**"Auserlesen":** An elegant and high-quality design that emphasizes the excellence and award-winning quality of Wetli wines.


### 3rd development: technical refinements - more than just Squarespace Standard

As Swiss Squarespace developers, we have brought all our expertise to bear here to create a unique shopping experience:


*  **Individual product filters:** We implemented an expert customization for the online store that enables individual filtering by grape variety, award or availability. This allows customers to quickly find exactly what they are looking for among the wide range of wines.
  

*  **Visual availability display:** The availability of wines is visualized by an intuitive bottle symbol (empty, half full, full) - a tailor-made function that goes beyond the standard.
  

*  **Dynamic awards table:** A technical highlight. We made clever use of Squarespace's categories to create a dynamic awards management system. The Wetli family can manage numerous awards centrally, which are then automatically displayed correctly both in an overall list and directly on the respective product page.
  

*  **Customized checkout:** To meet customer requirements, we implemented an individual checkout process that allows orders to be placed on account - a function that Squarespace does not offer out of the box.
  

*  **Detailed product information:** We created a clear table that displays characteristics such as dishes, ageing or drinking temperature with matching icons to provide customers with all the important information at a glance.


### Individual filters and labels

For the online store, we developed an individual filter function according to grape variety, award and availability. This allows customers to find the right wine quickly. Availability is shown by an intuitive bottle symbol (empty, half full, full) - a customized extension. Using Squarespace categories, we created a central award management system so that the Wetli family can easily maintain awards that automatically appear in the overall list and on product pages.


### Extended product characteristics and individual checkout process with order on account

We developed a customized checkout process for orders on account - a function not offered by Squarespace as standard. We also created a clear table with icons for dishes, ageing and drinking temperature to show customers all the important information at a glance.


### 4\. launch & continuous optimization: a partner for the future

The punctual launch was just the starting signal. With [our service packages](file:///Users/Noel_1/Development/repos/noevu-new-2/extracted-content/old-site-backup/html/en/squarespace-hilfe.html), we ensure smooth, secure operation and are on hand as a technical partner for the ongoing development and SEO of the online wine store.


## The result: a website that inspires customers and winemakers

The result is a prime example of successful **web design for winegrowers in Switzerland** . Thanks to the individual expert customizations, the **new homepage for the winery** is much more than a digital business card - it is a powerful sales tool. Weinbau Wetli now has a professional platform that tells its story authentically and whose technical finesse significantly improves the online sales process for its customers.

This is how good the new winegrowing website looks:


### That's what the customer says:

> ### "We are delighted with the result and are very happy with our new winegrowing website. It's super easy to use the homepage ourselves and we get lots of compliments on our new website! Many thanks to Noel and the team!"
